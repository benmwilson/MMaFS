This project has two parts, one on memory management and one on file systems. The first component of the project takes a sequence of virtual addresses and extract the page number and offset for each address using bit-wise operations. The second component is a simple UNIX-like file system that resides on a disk that is 128KB in size.

### Project Outline

Part I: Memory management & Paging 

The purpose of this component is to implement a portion of the 
virtual to physical address translation in a pure paging based scheme. The goal is to 
write a program that takes a sequence of virtual addresses and extract the page number 
and offset for each address using bit-wise operations.

Part II: File Systems 

The goal of this component is to write a simple UNIX-like file system. The file system must follow these assumptions: 
 - The file system resides on a disk that is 128KB in size.
 - There is only one root directory. No subdirectories are allowed.
 - The file system supports a maximum of 16 files.
 - The maximum size of a file is 8 blocks; each block is 1KB in size.
 - Each file has a unique name, the file name can be no longer than 8 characters.
